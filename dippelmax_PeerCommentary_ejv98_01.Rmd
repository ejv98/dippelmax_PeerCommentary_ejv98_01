## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Challenge 1

### Could not get every third word

#ejv98 Comment: I used a different method from the stringr method, but I think in order to get every third word, you need to put quotations around every single word individually. It would look like vector<-c("Stately","plump","Buck","Mulligan"...) and so on. 


# Challenge 2
```{r}
# Challenge 2
m <- matrix(data = 1:80, nrow = 8, ncol = 10, byrow = FALSE)
m
x <- m[4, 5]
x
c2 <- m[ , 2]
c3 <- m[ , 3]
c6 <- m[ , 6]
x <- cbind(c2,c3,c6)
x
r6 <- m[6 , ]
r8 <- m[8 , ]
x <- cbind(r6,r8)
x
x <- m[2,2]:m[6,9]
```

#ejv98 Comments: I set mine up a little differently, but it runs well! 

# Challenge 3
```{r}
# Challenge 3
a <- array(data = 400:1, dim = c(5, 5, 4, 4))
a
a[1,1,1,2]
a[2,3,2,]
a[1:5, 1:5, 3, 3]
```

#ejv98 Comments: I set mine up the same way (I believe I missed a digit). Yours runs well.

# Challenge 5
```{r}
m <- matrix(data = c(3, 0, 1, 23, 1, 2, 33, 1, 1, 42, 0, 1, 41, 0, 2), nrow = 5, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
m
df <- data.frame(m)
df
new_df <- df[df$X2, ]
new_df
factor_df <- as.factor(df[df$X3, ])
factor_df
```

#ejv98 Comment: The first part (identifying and running m) works well, but for defining df, mine looked a little different. I wrote it as df<-as.data.frame(m3) (or in your case, m rather than m3).
